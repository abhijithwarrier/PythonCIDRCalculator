PYTHON GUI SCRIPT FOR USER-ENTERED IPv4 CIDR CALCULATOR USING ipaddress MODULE

ipaddress provides the capabilities to create, manipulate and operate on IPv4 and IPv6 addresses and networks. Pythonâ€™s ipaddress module is an underappreciated gem from the Python standard library. The functions and classes in this module make it straightforward to handle various tasks related to IP addresses, including checking whether or not two hosts are on the same subnet, iterating over all hosts in a particular subnet, checking whether or not a string represents a valid IP address or network definition, and so on.
